# Maven how to use multiple repositories?

- Here is a working example of how to use multiple repositories to download maven dependencies for `Maven 3.5`
- It's impossible to specify a dedicated repository to look up an artifact. Maven will look up all configured repositories one by one until the artifact is found. Just add the central mirror and internal repositories to the `settings.xml`

#### File location
- Ubuntu: On a ubuntu based system the `settings.xml` file is located at `/home/<user-name>/.m2/`

```
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<settings xsi:schemaLocation="http://maven.apache.org/SETTINGS/1.1.0 http://maven.apache.org/xsd/settings-1.1.0.xsd
http://maven.apache.org/SETTINGS/1.1.0 "
          xmlns="http://maven.apache.org/SETTINGS/1.1.0"

        <!-- 
        When you use the advanced syntax and configure multiple mirrors, keep in mind that their declaration order matters. When Maven looks for a mirror of 
        some repository, it first checks for a mirror whose <mirrorOf> exactly matches the repository identifier. If no direct match is found, Maven picks the 
        first mirror declaration that matches according to the rules above (if any). Hence, you may influence match order by changing the order of the 
        definitions in the settings.xml

        Examples:

        * = everything
        external:* = everything not on the localhost and not file based.
        repo,repo1 = repo or repo1
        *,!repo1 = everything except repo1

## Maven Dependency Search Sequence

When we execute Maven build commands, Maven starts looking for dependency libraries in the following sequence

- Step 1: Search dependency in local repository, if not found, move to step 2 else perform the further processing.
- Step 2: Search dependency in central repository, if not found and remote repository/repositories is/are mentioned then move to step 4. Else it is downloaded to local repository for future reference.
- Step 3: If a remote repository has not been mentioned, Maven simply stops the processing and throws error (Unable to find dependency).
- Step 4: Search dependency in remote repository or repositories, if found then it is downloaded to local repository for future reference. Otherwise, Maven stops processing and throws error (Unable to find dependency).

## Types of Maven Repositories

Maven repository are of three types. 

- local: Maven local repository is a folder location on your machine. It gets created when you run any maven command for the first time.
- central: Maven central repository is repository provided by Maven community. It contains a large number of commonly used libraries.
- remote: Sometimes, Maven does not find a mentioned dependency in central repository as well. It then stops the build process and output error message to console. To prevent such situation, Maven provides concept of Remote Repository, which is developer's own custom repository containing required libraries or other project jars.
